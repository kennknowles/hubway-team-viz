var introText = ["In order for the Hubway system to work, there must always be bikes and empty docks at each station when needed. One of Hubway's challenges is to redistrubute bikes in the system (on a daily or even hourly basis) to keep up with imbalances in rider's usage. While some stations show a dynamic equilibrium of departures and arrivals throughout the course of the day, popular commuting stations experience high net losses or gains in the morning and evening. We visualized traffic for each station and hour of the day and analyzed how different user groups contributed to this.",
		 " Since usage patterns change as new stations are installed, this graphic focuses only on the recent busy months of August and September 2012. Also the data here is restricted to Weekdays in order to highlight the critical imbalances that Hubway must account for to keep the system working. Weekend traffic represents more casual users and a more balanced overall usage."];

Between 7am and 9am on a typical weekday 75 bikes depart from North Station. This station's capacity is 47 bikes. Hubway re-supplies bikes at active stations like this one to keep the system working during peak times. The evening is even more dramatic, with on average of net 88 bikes arriving at North Station over a 5 hr window.",

Looking at the data there is an average of one person leaving every morning who doesn't return via Hubway. Are you that person that only likes to ride downhill? This station has only 15 docks, so Hubway has to refill the station ",// Ha ha wonder if they are a registered user, then we could find out who they are!!
